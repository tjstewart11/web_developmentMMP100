        <p> Ted elects to wait in the long line. While waiting, a child spills their drink on him. He also gets gum on the bottom of his shoe, but at last gets on the ride. His patience pays off, as he gets a seat right in the front, far way from annoyinh children and parents who don't pay attention. He gets on more rides after, but none compare to the first one.</p>
